How to use the Graham Library System
Key info:
•The book id has a range from 1000-1060 to be valid 
•Member Id must be above or equal to 11000 but less than 12000 to be valid
•For the checkout function when the date is asked for you need to make sure the month is written as its position in the year so 13/08/2022 will cause the program to not run correctly but 13/8/2022 runs the program perfectly
•There is a lag time between when the logfile.txt is updated after checking out a book,reserving a book and  so either reopen logfile.txt or wait some time
•The code for the matplotlib bar graph that represents the budget spending is generalised so depending on how the logfile.txt is updated or changed the bar graph changes accordingly
•When trying to reserve, checkout or return book logfile.txt needs to be updated hence, remember to open the logfile.txt such that it is on a newline so it appends there
